# About his playing style with auto-accompaniment:

He used these Technics arranger keyboards: KN-1000, KN-1200, KN-2000, KN7000   
KN-3000 and SX-FA1 will work, they have the same styles (not sure if all or just some).  
Unconfirmed, may not work: KN-650  
KN1000 Styles are compatible with KN750 - maybe KN750 works too?

Confirmed Technics names of some the styles he used:  
Folk Rock 1, Hard Rock, Country B beat, Modern Country

No info on styles or anything so far.

A HUGE DUMP OF STYLE FILES CONVERTED FOR YAMAHA PSR FORMAT!!!

# SOFTWARE BASED auto-accompaniment, DIY:

ORG24 - free (limited), cheap, PC version is better, has mobile verions too  
https://www.sofeh.com/

vArranger2 - sound engine was missing, very expensive paid, got it running by installing Coolsoft VirtualMIDISynth and using it as midi out  
https://www.varranger.com/

Band-in-a-Box - haven't tested yet  
https://www.pgmusic.com/

The Accompaniment Machine (AMac) - Free, got it to work with VirtualMIDISynth as midi out, then it stopped working and I don't know why  
https://kbd-infinity.com/accompaniment_machine.html

# More unsorted / unedited info and notes:

What worked for me so far:  

I downloaded jjazzlab and put the KN2000 styles from the other link  
the style corresponding to Folk Rock 1 is rock1c.sty  
that's like half his songs, i don't know the others yet  

for the sound i tried like 2 dozen soundfonts because i cant find an original rip  
no one is the same but the closest at least in spirit and style is this one:  
https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1304

for playing live i tried vArranger2 and Real-time Style Performer in tandem with VirtualMIDISynth  
both worked with minor glitches like wrong or missing sounds fixed by reloading the style or the sf2  
VirtualMIDISynth does not use ASIO for me and has latency  
i'll have to try some sf2 player in reaper and figure out the midi routing
