title: About this website

*I hated every insufferable second of making this website or blog or whatever.*  
  
I had never used jekyll before.  
First day everything kept breaking.  
Tutorials I read didn't work out and all the files were missing.  
I either broke whatever I tried installing or I didn't understand how.  
All the themes were too bloated and complicated for my needs anyway.  
Also my first time I try using Git properly and I was constantly messing up.  
  
Then I started the "step by step tutorial" from the official jekyll website.  
This tutorial was the best by far and actually explained what's happening.  
Yet again I couldn't make it work.  
Then it suddenly worked, but I broke it again many times.  
I started to slowly somewhat understand WTF is going on.  
Then I *DELETED EVERYTHING* except the absolute bare minimum functionality.  
It became much more minimal than any minimal themes I had found...  
*Maybe it is the most minimal of all?*  
And then I started configuring and styling from scratch.  
I manually added only what I want - the *Arch way*, lol XD  
I still had a lot of stuff break, but I managed to repair everything.  
I'm happy now and I enjoy the minimalism.  
It's very amateurish, but I genuinely like it - it's not a cope. :)  
  
So I can "proudly" say that, while writing this, I have:  
one layout  
one collection  
one small css file  
one small html table  
one sleep depravation  
one frustration  
one resentment  
one undisclosed amount of beer  
  
I feel better after writing this.  
To whoever reads all this:  
I find it hilarious how you've wasted your time here, lol XD
